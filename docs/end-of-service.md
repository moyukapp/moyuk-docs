# End of Service Announcement

I regret to inform you that Moyuk will be discontinuing its service. I want to thank all users for their support and provide important information about the service termination.

## Important Dates

- **Service End Date**: June 1, 2025, 00:00 UTC
- **Last Day for New Registrations and Creating New Apps**: May 17, 2025, 00:00 UTC

## What This Means For You

### Existing Users
- All user accounts and associated data will be permanently deleted on June 1, 2025
- No new apps can be created after May 17, 2025
- Existing apps will continue to function until the service end date
- Please save any app code you wish to keep before the service end date by copying it from the app editor

### Data Handling
- All user data will be permanently deleted on June 1, 2025
- This includes:
  - User accounts and profiles
  - Apps and their associated data
- I recommend backing up any important code before the service end date

## Why The Service is Ending

I have made the difficult decision to end Moyuk for several reasons:

1. **Resource Allocation**: I need to focus resources on other projects
2. **Maintenance Burden**: The ongoing maintenance requirements have become unsustainable
3. **Market Changes**: With the rise of AI technologies, there has been a decrease in demand for this specific service

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I still use my apps until the end date?
Yes, all existing apps will continue to function normally until June 1, 2025, 00:00 UTC.

### How can I save my app code?
To save your app code:
1. Open each app in the editor
2. Copy the TypeScript code
3. Save it to your local machine
Please do this well before the service end date.

### What if I have questions not answered here?
