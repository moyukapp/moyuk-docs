# Introduction to Moyuk

[Moyuk](https://moyukapp.com/) simplifies the creation and sharing of custom web tools.
Write a TypeScript function, and Moyuk handles the rest.
It generates UIs based on your function type and runs it in a sandboxed environment in the browser.

- No need for frameworks or boilerplates.
- Utilize npm packages and remote modules, just like in Deno.
- Publish your apps to share them with others.
