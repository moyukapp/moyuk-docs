:::

[Moyuk](https://moyukapp.com/) simplified the creation and sharing of custom web tools.
You could write a TypeScript function, and Moyuk handled the rest.
It generated UIs based on your function type and ran it in a sandboxed environment in the browser.

- No need for frameworks or boilerplates.
- Utilized npm packages and remote modules, just like in Deno.
- Published apps could be shared with others.
