# End of Service Announcement

Moyuk has discontinued its service as of June 1, 2025, 00:00 UTC. I want to thank all users for their support during the service's operation.

## Service Termination Details

- **Service End Date**: June 1, 2025, 00:00 UTC ✅ **Completed**
- **Last Day for New Registrations and Creating New Apps**: May 17, 2025, 00:00 UTC ✅ **Completed**

## What Happened

### Service Status
- The Moyuk service was permanently discontinued on June 1, 2025
- The database has been suspended and is no longer accessible
- All data will be permanently deleted on June 30, 2025

### Data Preservation
If you urgently need any data that was stored in your Moyuk account, please contact me directly at hello@moyukapp.com. I will handle such requests on a case-by-case basis during this period.

Please note that no further announcements will be made regarding the final data deletion on June 30, 2025.

### Final Period
- New app creation was disabled after May 17, 2025
- Existing apps continued to function until the service end date of June 1, 2025
- Users had the opportunity to save their app code by copying it from the app editor

## Why The Service Ended

I made the difficult decision to end Moyuk for several reasons:

1. **Resource Allocation**: I needed to focus resources on other projects
2. **Maintenance Burden**: The ongoing maintenance requirements had become unsustainable
3. **Market Changes**: With the rise of AI technologies, there was a decrease in demand for this specific service

## Thank You

I sincerely thank everyone who was part of the Moyuk community. Your support and engagement made this project meaningful during its operation.
