We collect personal data when you create an account with us or update your public profile on our service. We also collect personal data when you use third-party services to sign in to our service, such as GitHub or Google.

Non-personal data is any information that does not identify you as an individual, such as your browser type, device type, IP address, or usage statistics.

## How do we share your information?

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data with any third parties for their own purposes. However, we may share your personal data with third parties in certain situations:

Our servers are located in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and maintained on servers located in the United States.
Please note the country to which personal data is transferred may not provide the same level of protection for personal information as the country from which it was transferred.

## How do we protect your information?

We take reasonable measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, modification, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that your personal data will be completely secure or free from errors, loss, theft, or misuse. Please notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized activity on your account or any breach of security.

## How long do we keep your information?

We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide you with our service and its features, or as required by law. We may delete or anonymize your personal data when it is no longer needed for these purposes, or when you request us to do so.
